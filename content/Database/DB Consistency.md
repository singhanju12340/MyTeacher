|Feature|Eventual Consistency|Strong Consistency|
|---|---|---|
|Latency|Lower latency, faster responses|Higher latency due to synchronization requirements|
|Availability|High availability, tolerant to partitions|Potentially lower availability during partitions|
|Consistency|Eventually consistent, may be temporarily stale|Immediate and strong consistency, always up-to-date|
|Use Cases|Social media, DNS, caching|Financial transactions, inventory systems|
|Examples|Cassandra, DynamoDB, Couchbase|MySQL, PostgreSQL (ACID), Google Spanner|

### Summary:

- **Eventual Consistency**: Prioritizes availability and partition tolerance. Suitable for applications where temporary inconsistencies are acceptable.
- **Strong Consistency**: Prioritizes immediate accuracy and correctness. Suitable for applications where data consistency is critical at all times.

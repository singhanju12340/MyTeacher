2^30=1,073,741,824 =**1 billion, 73 million, 741 thousand, 824**.   **1 gigabyte (GB)** in computing terms, where 1 GB=2^30
2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 : **18 quintillion, 446 quadrillion, 744 trillion, 73 billion, 709 million, 551 thousand, 616**.
2^32=4,294,967,296 = **4 billion, 294 million, 967 thousand, 296**.




1 Million = 10^6
1 Billion = 10^9
1 Trillion = 10^12


1B = 8 bits
1KB = 1024 B
1mB = 1024 KB
1 GB = 1024 mB

1 Char=8 bits=1 byte {-128 to 127} {-2^7+1 to 2^7}

1 Million/ Day = 12 Sec
10 Million/ Day = 120 Sec
1 Billion / Day = 720 Sec
1 Million / Day = 720 Min

**Always trying Rounding Off in power of 10 or 2**


### Availability Estimates:
#### 99.9% availability:
**Total time in a year** = 365 days = 365 × 24 hours = **8,760 hours**
**99.9% uptime** = 0.999 × 8,760 hours = **8,751.24 hours of uptime**
**Allowable downtime** = 8,760 - 8,751.24 = **8.76 hours**
Thus, **99.9% availability** allows for approximately **8 hours and 45 minutes of downtime per year**.



1000 MB * 1M = 1TB



Hexadecimal is a [number system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-system-in-maths/) combining "hexa" for 6 and "deci" for 10. It uses 16 digits: 0 to 9 and A to F,where A stands for 10, B for 11, and so on.
example, in the number 7B3, 7 is multiplied by 16 squared, B by 16 to the power of 1, and 3 by 16 to the power of 0.
(A7B)16 = A × 162 + 7 × 161 + B × 160(convert symbols A and B to their decimal equivalents; A = 10, B = 11)
herefore, the decimal equivalent of (A7B)16 is (2683)10.




64 Bit === 2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616  === to Million == 1.8447×1013 million
32 bit == 2 Billion singed, 4 Billion unsigned

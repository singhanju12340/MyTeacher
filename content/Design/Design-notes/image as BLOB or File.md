**BLOB**: Binary Large Object
1. DB has acid properties
2. DB indexing can provide better search and retrieval capabilitites
3. Mutability: BLOB storage allows for easy updates and changes to image data.

**Cons:**
1. Overhead for Immutable Data: When images are mostly immutable (only a few bytes change when updated), the overhead of storing them in a database may not be cost-effective
2. Performance for Read-Heavy Workloads: Retrieving images from a database can be slower for read-heavy workloads, especially when serving images to a large number of users


**File Storage in a Distributed File System, e.g Hadoop HDFS or Amazon S3**

- Scalability: Distributed file systems are highly scalable and can handle massive volumes of image data.
- Cost-Effective: They are often more cost-effective, particularly for applications with dynamic scaling requirements and pay-as-you-go pricing.
-  Parallel Processing: Distributed file systems, like HDFS, are designed for parallel processing, making them suitable for image analysis and processing.
- Data Replication (HDFS): In HDFS, data replication ensures fault tolerance, reducing the risk of data loss due to hardware failures.
**Cons:**
No indexing
No ACID properties
No fine grain access control

By combining database storage for metadata and a distributed file system for actual image files, you strike a balance between data consistency, performance, and cost-efficiency, making it a practical solution for many image storage scenarios.

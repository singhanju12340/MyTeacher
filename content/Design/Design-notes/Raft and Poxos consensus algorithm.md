Distributed systems are complex systems that consist of multiple interconnected nodes, each of which can operate independently and potentially hold different copies of the same data. To ensure that all nodes work towards the same goal and have a consistent view of the data, it is necessary to establish some form of consensus among the nodes.


 Raft is used in **distributed databases like etcd and CockroachDB** to coordinate data replication and ensure consistency across nodes. Distributed Key-Value Stores: Raft is employed in distributed key-value stores like Consul to manage distributed configuration data and service discovery
# Implementing the Raft Algorithm

Now that we have a basic understanding of how the Raft algorithm works, let's look at how it can be implemented in practice.

At a high level, the Raft algorithm can be implemented using the following steps:

1. Initialize the system with a set of nodes and a shared log.
2. Periodically elect a leader from among the nodes.
3. The leader can accept and replicate new log entries to the other nodes.
4. Ensure that all nodes have a consistent view of the log by sending and receiving heartbeats.

Let's take a closer look at each of these steps in turn.

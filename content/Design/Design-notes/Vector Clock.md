Vector clocks are a mechanism used in [distributed systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-distributed-system/) to track the causality and ordering of events across multiple nodes or processes.

We can not relied on system timestamp to resolve conflict and update latest data. because system clock can have incorrect time if its not synced frequently with NTP servers.
